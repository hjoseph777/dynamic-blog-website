Assignment Overview: Build a Dynamic Blog Website
# JavaScript Multi-Page Blog Website with Local Storage

This is a Blog Website made with JavaScript that works right in your web browser. You can write, view, edit, and remove blog posts. Everything saves directly to your browser's storage, so you don't need any special server. The project code is saved on GitHub so others can work on it too.
